    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Distributed Tracing with APM workshop! \n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains a \"dummy\" microservices project, a single page web application with microservices, ready to be instrumented and analyzed using Datadog's APM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using features like the Service Map and Trace Search, we'll see how a APM can help alleviate some of the complexity of writing and deploying code for a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dashboard Image](images/service-map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code itself is run using `docker-compose`, which should now be bundled with [Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and [MacOS](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) versions of Docker. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux, Docker can be installed with your preferred method, and `docker-compose` should be available via a `pip install docker-compose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Docker allows us to set up multiple microservices locally, giving us an environment to rapidly build, test, and instrument our demo distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[I've](http://www.twitter.com/burningion) worked hard to make this workshop as helpful possible, but if you see something that could be improved, please feel free to create a [Github issue](https://github.com/burningion/distributed-tracing-with-apm-workshop) on the repo. "

    "The first thing you'll want to do is create a [Datadog account](https://www.datadoghq.com), and download this repo. \n",

    "$ POSTGRES_USER=postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pg password> DD_API_KEY=<api key> docker-compose up\n",

    "Before we go through instrumenting our code in the workshop, let's quickly take a look at what Datadog's APM gives us out of the box for our code."
